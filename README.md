## Professional Portfolio

For this challenge I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio which will be added to over time to become my own personal portfolio of work. I used what I have learned in the first two weeks of the bootcamp to write the HTML and CSS from scratch, while keeping in mind the following requirements:

Site is divided into several sections, including About Me, My Work, and Contact Info.
I included functioning navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to any of the sections
I included a link to a microsoft page  of my current resume.
I included a recent avatar photo of myself.
